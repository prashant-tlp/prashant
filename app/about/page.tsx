            I'm Prashant, a former gearhead <strong>(Mechanical Engineer)</strong> and current coding enthusiast. While
            I loved the world of mechanics, the pull of creativity and user
            connection in web development proved too strong. Now, I'm leveraging
            my analytical mind and problem-solving skills to build intuitive and
            impactful web experiences. I'm actively building projects showcasing
            my skills in Web-Developement. Excited to keep learning,
            collaborating, and contributing meaningful solutions. Want to join
            the journey? Explore my portfolio and let's connect!
