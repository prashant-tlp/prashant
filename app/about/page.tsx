            I&apos;m Prashant, a former gearhead <strong>(Mechanical Engineer)</strong> and current coding enthusiast. While
            I loved the world of mechanics, the pull of creativity and user
            connection in web development proved too strong. Now, I&apos;m leveraging
            my analytical mind and problem-solving skills to build intuitive and
            impactful web experiences. I&apos;m actively building projects showcasing
            my skills in Web-Developement. Excited to keep learning,
            collaborating, and contributing meaningful solutions. Want to join
            the journey? Explore my portfolio and let&apos;s connect!
